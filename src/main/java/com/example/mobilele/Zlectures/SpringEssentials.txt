        Everything new we have done in the lecture

HTML:
    name="attribute" -> for every input label
        it will not transfer if we don't give it a name despite the id

    ${T(com.example.mobilele.model.enums.EngineEnum).values()}
        way of using a variable but can be done with ${engines} too

@Controller:

    @PostMapping -> creating something
            Like post a photo
            Filling a form with data

    @GetMapping -> wants something
            Getting to a specific URL -> going to new page
