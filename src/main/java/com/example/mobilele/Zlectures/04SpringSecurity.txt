        Spring Security

    Filters and Interceptors:
        Servlet Filter = Spring Security

        Request ->   Servlet Filter  -> Dispatcher Servlet  - - >  Controller

    Project creation:
    Jakarta EE -- Web application -- Tomcat
       ^                          ^
       |  non Spring application  |


    Filter Chain
       Request    - ->   Filter1  ->  Filter2   - ->    Dispatcher Servlet

    Filter before sending the request
    Filter before sending the response

    Interceptors usage:
    Downtime -> when we don't want the site to be reachable
    Blacklist -> ban by IP address


    Spring Security:
        Focuses on Authentication
               and Authorization

        Authentication -> Who is logged in
        Authorization  -> What you are allowed to do

      Authentication class
        Principal       Credentials     Authorities
